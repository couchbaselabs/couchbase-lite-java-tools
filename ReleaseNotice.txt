JAK release 3.2.4 Minor release candidate RC-1 is ready.

Changes since 3.2.3:

    * Recalibrate flaky tests
    * Fix offlineHandler
    * Fix certificate locality DN
    * Clarify the location of JUnit the assert methods.
    * update LiteCore to 3.2.4-2
    * versionCode 3.2.4

All dev and E2E tests passed with the following exceptions:

  QueryTest.testStringToUTC which failed on two of three Android devices.  This is a testing issue caused by a disagreement between two libraries on the test device about what UTC means.

  Several Load tests failed on the slowest Android device.

All artifacts (except the Linux support libs) are on the internal maven server: https://proget.sc.couchbase.com/maven2/internalmaven/
